## MCB290 Undergraduate Research Projects (Overview)

What does MCB290 look like in the Van Bortle lab? We are a data-driven genomics lab primarily interested in understanding RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcription regulation, including mechanisms of Pol III overactivity in cancer. Undergraduate research projects are built around developing proficiency in common data analysis and visualization techniques, and applying these skills to biological questions centered on tRNA dynamics in tissues and tumors. 

Undergraduate research projects will require the use of publicly available datasets (e.g. TCGA, ENCODE, etc.) and tools for high-throughput data analysis. This repository is intended to serve as a hub for onboarding, materials, and relevant resources.


## Learning Objectives

As an undergraduate researcher, you are expected to gain proficiency in
- Understanding basic principles of functional genomics methods, including current sequencing, computational, and statistical approaches
- Interpret common data analysis and visualization techniques and apply these approaches using programming in R
- Integrate multi-omic data to generate quantitative analyses related to the regulation and function of a specific gene of interest.
